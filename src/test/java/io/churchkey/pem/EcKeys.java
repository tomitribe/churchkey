     * Despite the appearance that you can supply valid parameters via ECParameterSpec

     * 
     * OpenJDK's CurveDB class will explicitly reject valid ECParameterSpecs
     * if it cannot map it back to an instance of its internal NamedCurve class.
     * This is unfortunate as it doesn't appear anything significant stops these
     * valid ECParameterSpecs from working.
     *
     * Since each JVM version and vendor has a different behavior here, there's
     * no way to reliably exclude these curves from the tests.  So we test them
     * all and ignore the complaint that the curve is unknown.  Hopefully these
     * curves will be added in later JVM versions
